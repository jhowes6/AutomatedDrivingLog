# AutomatedDrivingLog

Automated Driving Log automatically records driving sessions while allowing the user to view their location on a map. For each driving session, the date, time, and duration are all automatically recorded by the app. Each session is then stored permanently in a database. The Automated Driving Log also automatically detects when the user stops driving. This prevents drivers from being able to falsify their driving record by recording sessions when they are not actually driving.
